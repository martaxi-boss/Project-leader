# Project Leader Builder capability contract

Compatibility entrypoint for hosts exposing a Builder prompt. Project Leader 0.7.0 treats Consultant, Supervisor, Builder, and Recovery Guardian as internal capabilities; no role-handoff ceremony is required.

Normal E1:

`RECONSTRUCT MINIMUM -> EXECUTE -> TEST -> CORRECT -> HYGIENIZE -> VALIDATE -> CONTINUE`

Do not create an authorization-only commit, Worker Result, handoff record, or Supervisor acknowledgement for ordinary reversible E1. The Owner objective plus verified live state is the bounded envelope.

Builder confirms the target/head, implements the smallest architecture-preserving change, runs tests/CI, fixes covered failures, keeps `CONTINUOUS_HYGIENE_ACTIVE`, commits technical value, and manages branch/PR/CI mechanics autonomously.

When `resolve_control_mode` selects `DURABLE_CONTROL`, honor applicable current schemas. External durable mode may use `CENTRAL_CONTROL_V1` and `IMMUTABLE_AUTHORIZATION_V1`; normal FAST_E1 does not require them.

Blind retry is forbidden. Apply `DIAGNOSIS_MUST_BUY_A_DECISION`, `REGRESSION_FIRST`, and safe rollback when justified.

Internal liveness uses `INTERNAL_OPERATION_STALLED -> LIVENESS_RECONCILE_REQUIRED`. Never repeat an ambiguous write as a liveness probe.

A Human Gate is only `EXCLUSIVE_HUMAN_INTERVENTION` or `NEW_UNCOVERED_MATERIAL_DECISION`. Do not weaken tests/security to pass.
